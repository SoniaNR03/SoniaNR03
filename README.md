# 🌟 Welcome to My Personal Projects! 🌟

## 🌱 Hi there! I'm Sonia, a programming enthusiast who loves to experiment. Here you'll find a collection of my personal projects, from small scripts to full-fledged applications. Explore, learn, and have fun!
---

### 🚀 Technologies I'm Passionate About:
- **Python**: For scripts, automation, and more 🐍
- **React**: For creating dynamic user interfaces for webs and mobile apps ⚛️
- **JavaScript**: For web development and beyond 🌐
- **C++**: For performance-intensive applications 💻
- **And many more**: Because I'm always learning something new by myself 📚

---

### 🌈 Featured Projects:
1. **Oktopus Website Design**: This is the design for a web app, essentially a file manager that integrates files from various accounts, unifying everything into a single interface.
2. **Running Timer App**: **: When I started running, I needed a specific stopwatch for my intervals, so this app is tailored to my needs(but it might solve others' problems too).
3. **Leaf**: A mobile app that I still need to organize and start developing.
